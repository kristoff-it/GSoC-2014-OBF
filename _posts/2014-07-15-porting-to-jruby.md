title: Porting things to JRuby
---

I'm working on porting all scripts on Jruby.
Sure (real) multithreading is nice and MongoDB is way faster than RethinkDB although some small details are not as nice.

Now that I'm free from other commitments I'll start updating daily (or almost) the blog with my progress.

In the meantime most of the import operations have already been ported to Jruby and you can find them in a new [[GitHub repo]](https://github.com/kappaloris/vcf-mongo).
