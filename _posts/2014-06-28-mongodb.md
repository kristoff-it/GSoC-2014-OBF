title: RethinkDB is nice but kinda slow :(
---

Now that I have a complete understanding of what is needed and what is not (altough some things might not be needed but still nice to have), I can now assert with certainty that the whole system can be adapted to basically any DBMS without having to force things. 

### MongoDB ###
On that note, while talking with my menthor, it came up the fact that mongo is quite faster at importing data compared to rethinkdb. This difference has also been aggravated by the fact that the latest version of rethinkdb switched its communication protocol from ProtocolBuffers to plain JSON. For python this is even worse because using the native C++ protobuf compiler you could still have some kind of parallelism, but now that it's JSON, thanks to the GIL, you absolutely cannot.

You can find the changelog for rethinkdb 1.13 [[here]](http://rethinkdb.com/blog/1.13-release/).

Since the difference in terms of time is quite a lot (10mins vs 90mins for 6 millions records) I will now start considering the possibility of switching DBMS.
